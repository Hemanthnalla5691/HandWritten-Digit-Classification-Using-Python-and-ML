# HandWritten-Digit-Classification-Using-Python-and-ML
This project is a handwritten digit classification app built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras. It utilizes the popular MNIST dataset and provides a web-based sketchpad interface using Gradio, allowing users to draw digits (0â€“9) and receive real-time AI predictions.
